// Given an input x, we want the remainder when x is divided by
// 4.  The remainder function is
//
// f(x) := x mod 4
//
// This can be implemented as follows.  Define the quotient by
// q := floor(x / 4), where the floor(x) function is simply
// the integer part of a floating point number x. Define the
// number n := 4 * q and the remainder can be calculated as
// r := x - n.  This solution is optimal, according to the
// game.
reg = input;      // Read number x.
int = reg / 4;    // The quotient q := floor(x / 4).
int = 4 * int;    // The number n := 4 * q.
int = reg - int;  // The remainder r := x - n.
output = int;     // Print the remainder.
