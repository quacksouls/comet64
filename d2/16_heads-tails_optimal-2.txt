// In 100 coin flips, we have the following cases:
//
// (1) The number of tails is 50, so a draw.
// (2) The number of tails is at least 51, so tails wins.
// (3) The number of tails is less than 50, so heads wins.
//
// We only need to keep track of the number of tails.  Here we
// assume that the register "int" is initially zero.  This
// solution is optimal, according to the game.
