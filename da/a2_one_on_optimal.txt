> Task: Make both grid patterns identical.  First grid can be written by
> outputting true or false.  Second grid shows the solution.
// Only the first square is true.  All other squares are false.
// Assume the register "int" to be initially zero.  Test the
// value of the register and print the boolean result.
// Then increment the value of the register.  This solution is
// optimal, according to the game.
check int = 0;
