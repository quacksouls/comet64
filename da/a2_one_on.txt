> Task: Make both grid patterns identical.  First grid can be written by
> outputting true or false.  Second grid shows the solution.
// Only the first square is true.  All other squares are
// false.  Print true for the first square.  Use a loop to
// print false for all other squares.
output = true;       // Print true.
loop:                // Start of "loop".
    output = false;  // Print false.
    jump to: loop;   // Go to "loop".
