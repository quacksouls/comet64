loop:                       // Start of "loop".
    check int = 0;          // Are we unshading?
    jump if true: unshade;  // If so, go to "unshade".
    output = true;          // Otherwise, we shade.
    int = 0;                // Switch to unshade.
    jump to: loop;          // Go to "loop".
unshade:                    // The "unshade" branch.
    output = false;         // Unshade.
