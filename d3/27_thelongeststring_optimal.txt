// Similar to the previous solution.  However, we remove a
// jump instruction and a label.  We also add an explicit
// loop.  This solution is optimal, according to the game.
loop:
    check input = null;   // Any more strings?
    jump if true: print;  // If not, go to "print".
    str = input;          // Read the input string.
    int = str.length;     // How many characters in the string.
    check reg < int;      // New string has more characters?
    jump if false: loop;  // If not, go to "end".
    reg = int;            // Otherwise, note length
    switch str;           // Store the new string.
    jump to: loop;        // Go to "loop".
print:                    // The "print" branch.
    switch str;           // Retrieve the longest string.
    output = str;         // Print the longest string.
