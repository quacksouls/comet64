This guide is meant to\nhelp you obtain all achievements in the game. It presents solutions to all\nproblems. Some of the solutions are optimal, while others are not. An\nunoptimized solution is given to show you a simple (and hopefully easy to\nunderstand) solution to a particular problem. It is hoped that an unoptimized\nsolution would encourage and inspire you to craft your own (optimized) solution.\nEach optimized solution provided is meant to show you one way of efficiently\nsolving a particular problem. There might be multiple optimized solutions for a\nparticular problem. Your challenge is find or come up with another efficient\nsolution.\nIf you do not want any spoilers, the guide below might help:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2707070208\nThe following guide provides other optimized solutions:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385965404\n"},"doc/launch-discount.html":{"url":"doc/launch-discount.html","title":"Launch Discount","keywords":"","body":"Launch Discount\nProblem\nRead an integer from input, apply a 20% discount, and print the result.\n1. Launch discount, Comet 64\nSolution 1\nCalculate 20% of the original value. Subtract the 20% value from the original\nvalue. The result should be 80% of the original value.\nreg = input;      // Read the original value.\nint = reg * 0.2;  // Calculate 20% of original value.\nreg = reg - int;  // Subtract 20% value from original value.\noutput = reg;     // Print the result.\nSolution 2\nA 20% discount is the same as 80% of the original value. We must multiply the\noriginal value by 0.8.\nreg = 0.8;        // Percentage of original value.\nint = input;      // Read original value.\nint = int * reg;  // Value after discount.\noutput = int;     // Print the result.\nSolution 3\nA 20% discount is the same as 80% of the original value. We must multiply the\noriginal value by 0.8. No need for using the register reg to store the\nfraction 0.8. Simply multiply the input value by 0.8, store the result to a\nregister, and print the content of the register. This solution is optimal,\naccording to the game.\nreg = input * 0.8;  // Multiply original value by 0.8.\noutput = reg;       // Print the result.\n"},"doc/why-so-negative.html":{"url":"doc/why-so-negative.html","title":"Why so Negative?","keywords":"","body":"Why so Negative?\nProblem\nEach number from input is negative. Remove the negative sign and print the\nresult.\n2. Why so negative?, Comet 64\nSolution 1\nAny non-zero number multiplied by -1 would have the opposite sign. Given a\nnegative number, multiplying the number by -1 would result in a positive number.\nWe can rule out the possibility of an input being zero because the problem\nstates that each input is a negative number.\nint = -1;         // Store -1 in a register.\nreg = input;      // Read an input number.\nreg = reg * int;  // Multiply number by -1.\noutput = reg;     // Print the result.\nSolution 2\nSimilar to Solution 1. There is no need to store -1 in the\nregister int. We can directly multiply the input by -1. This solution is\noptimal, according to the game.\nreg = input * -1;  // Multiply input number by -1.\noutput = reg;      // Print the result.\n"},"doc/bmi-guest.html":{"url":"doc/bmi-guest.html","title":"BMI Guest","keywords":"","body":"BMI Guest\nProblem\nRead two values from input: the weight (kg) followed by the height (m).\nCalculate the body mass index (BMI) and print the result.\n3. BMI guest, Comet 64\nSolution\nLet w be the weight in kilograms (kg) and h the height in metres (m).

What goes up, Comet 64\nSolution 1\nWe need to output all integers from 1 to 100, inclusive. In a high-level\nprogramming language, we would typically use a loop as follows.\nint = 1;                 // Start at 1.\nloop:                    // Start of \"loop\".\n    output = int;        // Print the integer.\n    int++;               // Increment the current integer.\n    check int Solution 2\nSimilar to Solution 1. We can shave off a few lines by noticing\nthat, from the previous solution, the last two lines are not necessary. If the\nloop conditional is false, then we automatically exit the loop and reach the end\nof the program. Also note that we do not need a loop conditional. Use a loop to\nprint as many integers as necessary. Once the game detects we have output the\nrequired number of integers, the program ends.\nint = 1;            // Start at 1.\nloop:               // Start of \"loop\".\n    output = int;   // Print the integer.\n    int++;          // Increment the integer.\n    jump to: loop;  // Go to \"loop\".\nSolution 3\nSuppose we want to use 2 lines to output all integers from 1 to 100, inclusive.\nThe register int is initially zero. Incrementing that register would give us 1\nand we can output that value. Continue incrementing and outputting until we have\noutput all required integers.

Use a loop to print the\ncurrent integer, then decrement the integer. Exit the loop when the integer is\nnegative.\nint = 100;                // Start at 100.\nloop:                     // Start of \"loop\".\n    output = int;         // Print the integer.\n    int--;                // Decrement the integer by 1.\n    check int Solution 2\nSimilar to Solution 1.

Subtract the content of int from 100,\nwhich yields the next integer to be printed. Increment the content of int.

If the characters are not in\nlexicographic order, then swap the characters. Otherwise, move to the next pair\nof characters. Let i be the index of the left character in S. Initially\ni := 0. The index of the right character is i + 1. Let j be the integer\nrepresentation of the character at index i and k the integer representation\nof the character at index i + 1. If j , then set i := i + 1 and go on\ncomparing. Otherwise j > k so we interchange the two characters at indices i\nand i + 1, set i := 0, and compare characters starting from the beginning of\nS. Note that if two adjacent characters in S are not in lexicographic order,\nwe can find a smallest index i such that the characters at indices i and\ni + 1 can be swapped with each other. However, if the characters in S are in\nlexicographic order, then eventually the value of i is the same as the maximum\nindex of S. At this point, i is the last index of S, the index i + 1 is\nout of bound, hence S is sorted in lexicographic order.\nstr = input;               // Read a string S.\nint = 0;                   // Index i of left character.\nloop:                      // Start of \"loop\".\n    reg = str.length - 1;  // Index of last character.\n    check int  reg;       // Is left char > right char?\n    jump if true: swap;    // If so, go to \"swap\".\n    switch int;            // Retrieve index i.\n    int++;                 // Increment index i.\n    jump to: loop;         // Go to \"loop\".\nswap:                      // The \"swap\" branch.\n    switch int;            // Get index i; store left char.\n    str[int] = char;       // Right char at left index.\n    reg = int + 1;         // Index of right char.\n    switch int;            // Get left char; store index i.\n    char = int;            // Left char as character.\n    str[reg] = char;       // Left char at right index.\n    int = 0;               // Set i := 0.\n    jump to: loop;         // Go to \"loop\".\nprint:                     // The \"print\" branch.\n    output = str;          // Print the sorted string.\nSolution 2\nSimilar to Solution 1. However, instead of going from the first\ncharacter up to the last character of the string S, we traverse S from the\nlast character down to the first character. This should allow us to remove a few\nlines. Let i be the index of a character in S. Initially we have\ni := n - 1, where n is the number of characters in S. The character at\nindex i is the right character, whereas the character at index i - 1 is the\nleft character. If S is not sorted in lexicographic order, then we can find\nthe greatest index i such that the characters at indices i and i - 1 can\nbe interchanged. Swap the two adjacent characters, set i to the greatest index\nof S, and repeat the process. Otherwise, S is sorted in lexicographic order\nand eventually the index i is 0. We take the value i := 0 as the signal to\nprint the sorted string S.

Continue the process until we have considered all binary\ndigits in S. The final value of d is the decimal representation of S. The\nalgorithm essentially is to double our current value of d and add the current\nbinary digit under consideration. Use the register int to store the decimal\nrepresentation. Initially int holds 0, hence no need to perform the first\ndoubling operation.\nreg = input;\ncheck reg Solution 3\nThis solution is due to\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/werg0n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/hanni16\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/giraffe94\n\nfrom the guide\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385965404\nThe solution is optimal, according to the game. Here is an explanation of the\nsolution given by WeRGoN, one of the above guide's writers:\nThe main idea of this solution was: using simple mathematical operations on\n4-digit binary numbers (which are perceived as decimal), distribute the\nresults evenly enough to reduce them later to 0, 1, 2, ..., 15.  It seems\nthat I even managed to do this, but with too many lines, so I modernized the\nsolution a bit: I tried to do the same thing, but with pairs of binary\ndigits.\n\nIf we go back to my code:\nLine 1: add a magic constant (I'll explain it later).\nLines 2-6: we separate the 4-digit number into 2 pairs.\nLines 7-8: transform the first pair.\nLines 9-11: transform the second pair and add to the result from the first\none.\n\nI will begin the explanation with the transformation of pairs.  Each pair of\nbinary numbers can have 4 states: 00, 01, 10, 11 (i.e. 0, 1, 10, 11).  Our\ntask is to convert this series into 0, 1, 2, 3 using simple mathematical\noperations.  Using only multiplication/division operations, this is\nimpossible, because the series numbers 0, 1, 10, 11 are distributed very\nunevenly (the difference between 1 and 10 is tenfold, and between 10 and 11\nis only x1.1).  Ideally, you need to add some value to the numbers of the\nseries in order to at least slightly smooth this series, and then try to\nfind a divisor that will reduce it to 0, 1, 2, 3.  If this could not be done\nright away, then you would have to repeat these operations several times,\neach time slightly smoothing the row. But in this case, one cycle was\nenough.\n\nIf we add 4 to the series 0, 1, 10, 11, then we get the series 4, 5, 14, 15.\nBy what number should it be divided to get 0, 1, 2, 3?  It is important not\nto forget that the INT register doesn't round off real numbers, but cuts off\nthe fractional part.  Well, the necessary divisor is the number 5.\n\nNow we can convert two-digit binary numbers to decimal.  It remains only to\nmultiply the result of top bits pair by 4 and add it to the result of the\nsecond pair.\n\nAs for the magic number 404, we simply immediately add the number 4 to each\npair of binary digits so as not to waste two lines of code on this.\nreg = input + 404;\nreg = reg / 100;\nint = reg;\nreg = reg - int;\nreg = reg * 100;\nswitch reg;\nint = int / 5;\nint = int * 4;\nswitch reg;\nreg = reg / 5;\nint = int + reg;\noutput = int;\n"},"doc/no-duplicates-1.html":{"url":"doc/no-duplicates-1.html","title":"No Duplicates!","keywords":"","body":"No Duplicates!\nProblem\nRead 11 random one-digit numbers.

The only array we have access to is a string of characters.\nInterpret a string as an array of characters. Let i be an input one-digit\ninteger. If the character in str at index i is lower-case O (i.e. o), this\nis the first time we see i. Set the character in str at index i to x,\nmeaning we have seen the digit i. However, in case the character in str at\nindex i is x, then we have seen i already and this is the second time we\nare seeing i. Therefore i is a duplicate.\nstr = oooooooooo;         // Array of 10 elements.\nloop:                     // Start of \"loop\".\n    int = input;          // Read a one-digit integer i.\n    char = str[int];      // Peek at character with index i.\n    check char = x;       // Is character = x?\n    jump if true: print;  // If so, go to \"print\".\n    char = x;             // Otherwise, have not seen i yet.\n    str[int] = char;      // Mark the number as seen.\n    jump to: loop;        // Go to \"loop\".\nprint:                    // The \"print\" branch.\n    output = int;         // Print the duplicate number.\nSolution 2\nAll the one-digit integers are:\n0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 8, 9\nThe sum of these digits is\n0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 8 + 9 = 45\nLet x be a repeating digit. The sum of the 11 random one-digit numbers is\nS := 45 + x. The value of the repeating digit is therefore x := S - 45.\nloop:                     // Start of \"loop\".\n    check input = null;   // Any more digits to read?\n    jump if true: print;  // If not, go to \"print\".\n    int = int + input;    // Update cumulative sum.\n    jump to: loop;        // Go to \"loop\".\nprint:                    // The \"print\" branch.\n    int = int - 45;       // The duplicate digit.\n    output = int;         // Print the duplicate digit.\nSolution 3\nSimilar to Solution 2. However, after we have updated the\ncumulative sum, we check whether there are any more integers to read. This\nallows us to remove a jump instruction and a label.

Open the voodoo file, Comet 64\nThis achievement requires you to unlock the secret ending. On the home screen,\nyou should see four disks on the left side. On the right side are two disks and\ntwo text files. One of the text files is named \"voodoo\". To access this text\nfile, you need a 4-letter code. You do not need to solve all puzzles in a disk\nfor a character of the code to appear. Each character of the code is unlocked\nonce you have solved a certain number of puzzles in each disk on the left hand\nside. Solve the required number of puzzles in a disk and look for a box that\nsays code: , where  is a character of the 4-letter code. Note\nthe order of each letter from each of the four disks, going from disk 1 to\ndisk 4. Now click on the \"voodoo\" file, enter the 4-letter code, and you should\nbe presented with a bunch of text. The most useful part of the text is on the\nvery first line. This line shows a user name. Make note of the user name or copy\nit down somewhere. Quit the game, load the game again, and choose an empty save\nslot. If you do not have an empty slot, you must delete one of the save slots\nand choose the new empty slot. You would then be prompted to enter a user name.\nType in the user name you found in the \"voodoo\" file.\n58. The Master ending, Comet 64\nYou are now given one last puzzle to solve. Click on the box that says \"99.\nErRor\" and you would be presented with some lines of code. Run the code if you\nwant, but it would not solve the puzzle. Comment out the code. Now each input is\nan encrypted string. Decrypt each string and print the unscrambled string. The\ncommand output = str no longer works. You must use the command print str.\nEach encrypted string is obtained by interchanging the first and last characters\nof the string. To unscramble the string, all you need to do is swap these two\ncharacters around.\nstr = input;           // Read a string.\nchar = str[0];         // First character.\nswitch char;           // Store first character.\nint = str.length - 1;  // Index of last character.\nchar = str[int];       // Last character.\nstr[0] = char;         // Last character at first index.\nswitch char;           // Retrieve first character.\nstr[int] = char;       // First character at last index.\nprint str;             // Print decrypted string.\n"}}}
