> Task: Make both grid patterns identical.  First grid can be written by
> outputting true or false.  Second grid shows the solution.
// Grid cells are indexed from 1 onward.  Each cell with index
// greater than 13 is shaded.  All other cells are unshaded.
// Compare the cell index and shade accordingly.  We assume
// that the register "int" is initialized to zero at the start. 
// This solution is optimal, according to the game.
