> Task: Make both grid patterns identical.  First grid can be written by
> outputting true or false.  Second grid shows the solution.
// Use a string to encode the given pattern.  True is
// represented by "x" and false is represented by "o".
// The register "int" is initially zero.  Use the
// register as an index of the string.  We check whether
// the character str[int] is "x" or "o".  The result
// should be in the register "bool".  This solution is
// optimal, according to the game.
str = xoxooxoooxooooxoooooxooooooxoooo;  // The pattern.
char = str[int];  // The character str[i].
check char = x;   // Is character = "x"?
output = bool;    // Print result of test.
int++;            // Increment the index i.
