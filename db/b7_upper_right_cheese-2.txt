> Task: Make both grid patterns identical.  First grid can be written by
> outputting true or false.  Second grid shows the solution.
// The first half of the pattern is the same as the second
// half.  Use a loop to print the first half.  Each half has
// 16 boolean values.  Encode each half as a string.  Test
// whether the character at index i is "x" and print the
// boolean result.  This solution is optimal, according to
// the game.
str = xxxxoxxxooxxooox;   // Pattern of each half.
loop:                     // Start of "loop".
    char = str[int];      // Character at index i.
    check char = x;       // Is character = x?
    output = bool;        // Print boolean result.
    int++;                // Increment the index.
    check int = 16;       // Printed 16 boolean values yet?
    jump if false: loop;  // If not, go to start of "loop".
int = 0;                  // Reset the character index.
