> Task: Make both grid patterns identical.  First grid can be written by
> outputting true or false.  Second grid shows the solution.
// Use a string of "x" and "o" to encode the pattern.
//
// x := true
// o := false
//
// The register "int" is used as an index i to each string
// character.  Check whether str[i] is "x" and print the
// boolean result.  This solution has the least number of
// lines of code, but the number of steps is not optimal,
// according to the game.
