> Task: Make both grid patterns identical.  First grid can be written by
> outputting true or false.  Second grid shows the solution.
// Grid cells are indexed from 1 onward.  Each cell with index
// greater than 13 is shaded.  All other cells are unshaded.
// Compare the cell index, jump accordingly, and shade as
// required.  We assume the register "int" is initialized to
// zero at the start.
int++;                // Increment index.
check int > 13;       // Is index > 13?
jump if true: shade;  // If so, go to "shade".
output = false;       // Unshade.
jump to: end;         // Go to "end".
shade:                // The "shade" branch.
    output = true;    // Shade.
end:                  // End of program.
