> Task: Make both grid patterns identical.  First grid can be written by
> outputting true or false.  Second grid shows the solution.
// We have the pattern:
//
// oox
//
// Print this pattern over and over.  Let the game implicitly
// loop over the program to take care of the rest.  This
// solution is optimal, according to the game.
output = false;  // Print the pattern
output = false;  // oox over and over.
output = true;   //
