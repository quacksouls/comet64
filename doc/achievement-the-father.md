{% youtube id="bjPXJ1-jB24", title="60. The Father ending, Comet 64" %}{% endyoutube %}

The process to obtain this achievement is the same as per the process for
unlocking the achievement "The Master", except for one crucial step. For the
achievement "The Master", you are not required to solve every puzzle in each
disk. Solve only a particular number of puzzles in each of disk 1 to disk 4,
enough to allow you to see each character of the secret 4-letter code. However,
for the achievement "The Father" you must solve each puzzle in each of disk 1 to
disk 4. It is not necessary to get all stars for each puzzle. You are only
required to solve each puzzle. Solve all puzzles in disk 1 to disk 4, quit the
game, load the game again, and choose the save slot you created when you were
attempting to unlock "The Master" achievement. Solve the same puzzle that you
were given as per the achievement "The Master". In fact, you can re-use the same
code.
