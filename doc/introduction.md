# Introduction

Comet 64 is a game about solving programming problems. This guide is meant to
help you obtain all achievements in the game. It presents solutions to all
problems. Some of the solutions are optimal, while others are not. An
unoptimized solution is given to show you a simple (and hopefully easy to
understand) solution to a particular problem. It is hoped that an unoptimized
solution would encourage and inspire you to craft your own (optimized) solution.
Each optimized solution provided is meant to show you one way of efficiently
solving a particular problem. There might be multiple optimized solutions for a
particular problem. Your challenge is find or come up with another efficient
solution.
