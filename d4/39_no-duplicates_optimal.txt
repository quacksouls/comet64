// Reuse the solution to "38. No Duplicates!"
// Use an array of 10 elements.  The only array we have access
// to is a string of characters.  Interpret a string as an
// array of characters.  Let i be an input one-digit integer.
// If the character str[i] is lower-case O (i.e. "o"), this is
// the first time we see i.  Set str[i] to "a", meaning we
// have seen the digit i.  However, in case str[i] is "a",
// then we have seen i already and this is the second time we
// are seeing i.  Therefore i is a duplicate.  This solution
// is optimal, according to the game.
str = oooooooooo;         // Array of 11 elements.
loop:                     // Start of "loop".
    int = input;          // Read a one-digit integer i.
    char = str[int];      // Peek at element str[i].
    check char = a;       // Is str[i] = "a"?
    jump if true: print;  // If so, go to "print".
    char = a;             // Otherwise, have not seen i yet.
    str[int] = char;      // Set str[i] = "a".
    jump to: loop;        // Go to start of "loop".
print:                    // The "print" branch.
    output = int;         // Print the duplicate.
