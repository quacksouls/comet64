> Query: Input contains 11 random one-digit numbers.  Each number appears

// Use an array of 10 elements, because the one-digit numbers
// start from 0 and end at 9, inclusive.  The only array we
// have access to is a string of characters.  Interpret a
// string as an array of characters.  Let i be an input
// one-digit integer.  If the character in str at index i is
// lower-case O (i.e. "o"), this is the first time we see i.
// Set the character in str at index i to "x", meaning we have
// seen the digit i.  However, in case the character in str at
// index i is "x", then we have seen i already and this is the
// second time we are seeing i.  Therefore i is a duplicate.
str = oooooooooo;         // Array of 10 elements.
loop:                     // Start of "loop".
    int = input;          // Read a one-digit integer i.
    char = str[int];      // Peek at character with index i.
    check char = x;       // Is character = x?
    jump if true: print;  // If so, go to "print".
    char = x;             // Otherwise, have not seen i yet.
    str[int] = char;      // Mark the number as seen.
    jump to: loop;        // Go to "loop".
print:                    // The "print" branch.
    output = int;         // Print the duplicate number.
