// Any number multiplied by -1 would have the opposite sign.
// Given a negative number, multiplying the number by -1 would
// result in a positive number.  No need to store -1 in the
// "int" register.  We can directly multiply the input by -1.
// This solution is optimal, according to the game.
// Lines: 2
// Steps: 30
reg = input * -1;  // Multiply input number by -1.
output = reg;      // Print the result.
