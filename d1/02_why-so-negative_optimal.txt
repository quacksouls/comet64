// Any non-zero number multiplied by -1 would have the
// opposite sign.  Given a negative number, multiplying the
// number by -1 would result in a positive number.  We can
// rule out the possibility of an input being zero because
// the problem states that each input is a negative number.
// No need to store -1 in the "int" register.  We can directly
// multiply the input by -1.  This solution is optimal,
// according to the game.
reg = input * -1;  // Multiply input number by -1.
output = reg;      // Print the result.
