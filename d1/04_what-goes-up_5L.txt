// Similar to the previous solution.  We can shave off a few
// lines by noticing that, from the previous solution, the
// last two lines are not necessary.  If the loop conditional
// is false, then we automatically exit the loop and reach
// the end of the program.  Also note that we do not need a
// loop conditional.  Use a loop to print as many integers as
// necessary.  Once the game detects we have output the
// required number of integers, the program ends.
int = 1;            // Start at 1.
loop:               // Start of "loop".
    output = int;   // Print the integer.
    int++;          // Increment the integer.
    jump to: loop;  // Go to start of "loop".
