// Suppose we want to use 2 lines to output all integers from
// 1 to 100, inclusive.  We assume the register "int" to
// always start with the value 0.  Incrementing that register
// would give us 1 and we can output that value.  Continue
// incrementing and outputting until we have output all
// integers from 1 to 100, inclusive.  This solution is
// optimal, according to the game.
// Lines: 2
// Steps: 200
int++;         // Increment the integer.
output = int;  // Print the integer.
