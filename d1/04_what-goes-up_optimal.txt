// Suppose we want to use 2 lines to output all integers from
// 1 to 100, inclusive.  Assume the register "int" to
// initially hold zero.  Incrementing that register would give
// us 1 and we can output that value.  Continue incrementing
// and outputting until we have output all required integers.
// This solution is optimal, according to the game.
// Lines: 2
// Steps: 200
int++;         // Increment the integer.
output = int;  // Print the integer.
