// We have these definitions:
// w := The weight in kilograms (kg).
// h := The height in metres.
// BMI := w / m^2.
int = input;      // First, read the weight.
reg = input;      // Second, read the height.
reg = reg * reg;  // The square of the height.
reg = int / reg;  // The body mass index (BMI).
output = reg;
