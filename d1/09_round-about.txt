// We are rounding half up, i.e. round half toward positive
// infinity.  Define our rounding function as
// round(x) := floor(x + 0.5), where we use the floor()
// function.  The floor(x) function of a floating point number
// x is equivalent to the integer part of x.  This solution is
// optimal, according to the game.
reg = input;      // Read the input number.
int = reg + 0.5;  // The floor(x + 0.5) function.
output = int;     // Print the rounded integer.
