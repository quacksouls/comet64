// This solution exploits how floating point numbers are
// represented and handled in the Comet 64 computer.  The
// computer allows for up to two decimal digits following
// the decimal point.  If a floating point number cannot
// fit in the representation used by the computer, then
// the third decimal digit is rounded.  The rounding rule
// is rounding half up.  For example, the number 1.123 is
// rounded to 1.12 and 1.125 is rounded to 1.13.  To round
// an input number to the nearest integer, we divide the
// input by 100 so the computer would round the result to
// two decimal places.  Then multiply the rounded number by
// 100 to obtain the rounded integer.  This solution is
// optimal, according to the game.
// Lines: 3
// Steps: 45
reg = input / 100;  // Divide by 100 to trigger rounding.
int = reg * 100;    // Multiply by 100 to get rounded integer.
output = int;       // Print the rounded integer.
