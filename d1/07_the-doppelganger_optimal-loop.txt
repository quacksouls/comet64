// Similar to the previous solution.  However, we use a loop.
// This solution is optimal, according to the game.
loop:                     // Start of "loop".
    int = reg;            // Set current year to latest year.
    reg = input;          // Read a year from input.
    check int = reg;      // Are two year values the same?
    jump if false: loop;  // If not, go to "loop".
output = int;             // Print the duplicate year.
