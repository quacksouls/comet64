> Query: Output a countdown from 100 to 0, inclusive.  Ignore the input.
// We need to output all integers starting from 100 and count
// down to 0.  The count should include both 100 and 0.
// Assume the register "int" to be initially set to zero.  This
// solution is optimal, according to the game.
reg = 100 - int;
output = reg;
int++;
