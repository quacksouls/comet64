> Query: Output a countdown from 100 to 0, inclusive.  Ignore the input.
// Assume the register "int" to be initially set to zero.
// Subtract the content of int from 100, which yields the
// next integer to be printed.  Increment the content of int.
// We do not need an explicit loop because the game loops back
// to the start of the program once it has read the last line
// of code.  This solution is optimal, according to the game.
// Lines: 3
// Steps: 302
reg = 100 - int;
output = reg;
int++;
