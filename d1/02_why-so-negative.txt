// Any non-zero number multiplied by -1 would have the
// opposite sign.  Given a negative number, multiplying the
// number by -1 would result in a positive number.  We can
// rule out the possibility of an input being zero because
// the problem states that each input is a negative number.
// Lines: 4
// Steps: 60
int = -1;         // Store -1 in a register.
reg = input;      // Read an input number.
reg = reg * int;  // Multiply number by -1.
output = reg;     // Print the result.
