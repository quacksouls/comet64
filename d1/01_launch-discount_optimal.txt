> Query: Read the values from input and write them to output after a discount
> of 20 percent.
> Example:
> [input: 100, 20, 45]
> [output: 80, 16, 36]
// A 20% discount is the same as 80% of the original value.
// We must multiply the original value by 0.8.  No need for
// using the "reg" register to store the fraction 0.8.  Simply
// multiply the input value by 0.8, store the result to a
// register, and print the content of the register.  This
// solution is optimal, according to the game.
// Lines: 2
// Steps: 30
reg = input * 0.8;  // Multiply original value by 0.8.
output = reg;       // Print the result.
