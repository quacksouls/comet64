// Read the years, one at a time.  A year can occur twice in a
// row.  Print the duplicate years.  The register "int" is
// initially zero.  Assume this to be the case and read input
// into the register "reg" only.  We print only if two
// consecutive values from input are the same.  This solution
// does not use a loop.
reg = input;          // Read the year from input.
check int = reg;      // Are both values the same?
jump if true: print;  // If so, go to "print".
jump to: end;         // Otherwise, go to "end".
print:                // The "print" branch.
    output = int;     // Print the duplicate year.
end:                  // The "end" branch.
    int = reg;        // Set current year to latest year.
