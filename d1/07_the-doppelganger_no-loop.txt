// Read the years, one at a time.  A year can occur twice in a
// row.  Output the duplicate years.  The register int always
// start with 0.  Assume this to be the case and read input
// into the register reg only.  This solution does not use a
// loop.
reg = input;          // Read the year from input.
check int = reg;      // Are both values the same?
jump if true: print;  // If both are same values, print.
jump to: end;         // Otherwise, go to end.
print:                // If both years are the same...
    output = int;     // ...print the duplicate year.
end:                  // The end.
    int = reg;        // Set current year to latest year.
