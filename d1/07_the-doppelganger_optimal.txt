// Read the years, one at a time.  A year can occur twice in a
// row.  Output the duplicate years.  The register int always
// start with 0.  Assume this to be the case and read input
// into the register reg only.  This solution is optimal,
// according to the game.
reg = input;        // Read the year from input.
check int = reg;    // Are both values the same?
jump if false: end; // If values are different, go to "end".
output = int;       // Otherwise print the duplicate year.
end:                // The "end" label.
    int = reg;      // Set current year to latest year.
