> Query: For each 2 values from input, output the greater one.
// Similar to the previous solution.  We can eliminate some
// lines from the previous solution by noticing that we do
// not need a jump instruction when the conditional "x > y"
// is false.  If the conditional "x > y" is true, we jump to
// the branch that prints x.  Otherwise, we print y without
// having to jump to a different branch.  This solution is
// optimal, according to the game.
int = input;          // Read x from input.
reg = input;          // Read y from input.
check int > reg;      // Is x > y?
jump if true: print;  // If so, go to "print".
int = reg;            // Otherwise, set int to value of reg.
print:                // The "print" branch.
    output = int;     // Print the larger number.
