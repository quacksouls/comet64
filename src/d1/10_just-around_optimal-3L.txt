> Query: Input contains integer numbers only.  Round them to the nearest

> [input: 7, 26, 113]
> [output: 10, 30, 110]
// This solution exploits how floating point numbers are
// represented and handled in the Comet 64 computer.  The
// computer allows for up to two decimal digits following
// the decimal point.  If a floating point number cannot
// fit in the representation used by the computer, then
// the third decimal digit is rounded.  The rounding rule
// is rounding half up.  For example, the number 1.123 is
// rounded to 1.12 and 1.125 is rounded to 1.13.  To round
// an input number to the nearest tens, we divide the
// input by 1000 so the computer would round the result to
// two decimal places.  Then multiply the rounded number by
// 1000 to obtain the integer rounded to the nearest tens.
// This solution is optimal, according to the game.
reg = input / 1000;  // Round to 2 decimal places.
int = reg * 1000;    // Integer rounded to nearest tens.
output = int;        // Print rounded number.
