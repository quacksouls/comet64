// To round a floating point number to the nearest tens, we
// divide the number by 10 and treat the problem as if we are
// rounding the number to the nearest integer.  Then multiply
// the result by 10 to obtain the desired number.  The
// algorithm for rounding to the nearest integer is
// round(x) := floor(x + 0.5), where the floor(x) function of
// x is the same as the integer part of a floating point
// number x.  This solution is optimal, according to the game.
reg = input / 10;  // Divide the input by 10.
int = reg + 0.5;   // floor(x + 0.5)
int = int * 10;    // Multiply by 10 to undo division.
output = int;      // Print the result.
