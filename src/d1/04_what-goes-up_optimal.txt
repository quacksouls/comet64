// Suppose we want to use 2 lines to output all integers from
// 1 to 100, inclusive.  The register "int" is initially zero.
// Incrementing that register would give us 1 and we can
// output that value.  Continue incrementing and outputting
// until we have output all required integers.  This solution
// is optimal, according to the game.
int++;         // Increment the integer.
output = int;  // Print the integer.
