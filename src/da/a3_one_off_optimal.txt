> Task: Make both grid patterns identical.  First grid can be written by
> outputting true or false.  Second grid shows the solution.
// The first 31 squares are shaded, whereas square number 32
// is unshaded.  Print true for the first 31 squares.  This
// solution is optimal, according to the game.
check int < 31;  // Have we shaded 31 squares yet?
output = bool;   // Print boolean result.
int++;           // Increment count.
