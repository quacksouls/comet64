> Task: Make both grid patterns identical.  First grid can be written by
> outputting true or false.  Second grid shows the solution.
// For each grid cell, we have these definitions:
//
// true := shaded cell
// false := cell not shaded
//
// Each cell in grid 2 is shaded.  All we need to do is output
// true.  This solution is optimal, according to the game.
output = true;
