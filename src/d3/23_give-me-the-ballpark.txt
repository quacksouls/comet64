// Calculate the arithmetic mean of a bunch of numbers.  We
// assume that each of the registers "int" and "reg" is
// initially set to zero.  Read a number from input and keep
// track of the cumulative sum.  We also keep track of how
// many numbers we have read so far.  If there are no more
// input values, calculate and print the average.
int++;                // How many numbers read so far.
reg = reg + input;    // The cumulative sum.
check input = null;   // Any more numbers?
jump if true: print;  // If not, go to "print".
jump to: end;         // Otherwise, go to "end".
print:                // The "print" branch.
    reg = reg / int;  // The arithmetic mean.
    output = reg;     // Print the average.
end:                  // End of program.
