> Query: Output the last character of each string in input.
// Similar to the previous solution.  However, the index of
// the last character can be calculated in one instruction,
// instead of two.  This solution is optimal, according to
// the game.
str = input;           // Read the input string.
int = str.length - 1;  // Index of the last character.
char = str[int];       // The last character.
output = char;         // Print the last character.
