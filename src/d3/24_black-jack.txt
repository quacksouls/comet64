// Let the register "int" store the cumulative sum.  Assume
// the register initially holds zero.  We read a value into
// "reg", update the cumulative sum int := reg + int, and
// determine whether the updated cumulative sum is greater
// than 21.  If the value of "int" is at most 21, read in the
// next value.  Otherwise, the value of "int" is greater than
// 21 and we know that the newly read input value contributes
// to this updated sum.  Revert to the previous value of "int"
// and print the previous value.  Finally, assign the new
// input value to "int".  Continue the above process until we
// have no more values to read, at which point we simply print
// whatever value is held in "int".
loop:                     // Start of "loop".
    check input = null;   // Any more numbers?
    jump if true: end;    // If no more, go to "end".
    reg = input;          // Otherwise, read next value.
    int = reg + int;      // Update cumulative sum.
    check int > 21;       // Is sum > 21?
    jump if false: loop;  // If not, go to "loop".
    int = int - reg;      // Otherwise, use previous value.
    output = int;         // Print the previous value.
    int = reg;            // Now start with current input.
    jump to: loop;        // Go to "loop".
end:                      // The "end" branch.
    output = int;         // Print whatever is in "int".
