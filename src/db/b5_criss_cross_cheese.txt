> Task: Make both grid patterns identical.  First grid can be written by
> outputting true or false.  Second grid shows the solution.
// Encode the pattern as a string.  Check whether the
// character at index i is x and print the boolean result.
// This solution is optimal, according to the game.
str = ooxooxooxooooxooooxooooxooxooxoo;  // Encoded pattern.
char = str[int];  // Character at index i.
check char = x;   // Is character = x?
output = bool;    // Print boolean result.
int++;            // Increment index.
