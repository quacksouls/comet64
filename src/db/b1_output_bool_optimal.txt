// Similar to the previous solution.  However, we remove a
// jump instruction.  After checking for whether the index is
// greater than 13, we only need to print the content of the
// register "bool".  Assume the register "int" is initially
// zero.  This solution is optimal, according to the game.
int++;           // Increment index.
check int > 13;  // Is index > 13?
output = bool;   // Print boolean result.
