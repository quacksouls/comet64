// Note that we can print "x" first.  Next comes as many "o"
// as we need to print.  This solution is optimal,
// according to the game.
output = true;           // Shade a square.
reg++;                   // Increment max. unshaded squares.
int = 0;                 // Reset counter.
loop:                    // Start of "loop".
    output = false;      // Unshade a square.
    int++;               // Increment counter.
    check int < reg;     // Unshade another square?
    jump if true: loop;  // If so, go to "loop".
