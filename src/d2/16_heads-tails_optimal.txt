// Similar to the previous solution.  However, we do not need
// to make an explicit jump after we print the winner.  The
// game expects only one output.  After receiving an output,
// the game would terminate the program.  This solution is
// optimal, according to the game.
check input = null;            // Any more coin results?
jump if true: print;           // No more results, then print.
check input = heads;           // Is it heads?
jump if false: tails;          // If not, go to "tails".
reg++;                         // Increment number of heads.
jump to: end;                  // Branch to "end".
print:                         // The "print" branch.
    check reg > int;           // #heads > #tails?
    jump if true: printHeads;  // If true, go to "printHeads".
    check reg = int;           // A draw?

    output = tails;            // Tails wins.
printHeads:                    // The "printHeads" branch.

printDraw:                     // The "printDraw" branch.
