// In 100 coin flips, we have the following cases:
//
// (1) The number of tails is 50, so a draw.
// (2) The number of tails is at least 51, so tails wins.
// (3) The number of tails is less than 50, so heads wins.
//
// We only need to keep track of the number of tails.  Here we
// assume that the register "int" is initially zero.  This
// solution is optimal, according to the game.
loop:                      // Start of "loop".
    check input = null;    // Any more coin results?
    jump if true: winner;  // If not, go to "winner".
    check input = tails;   // Is it tails?
    jump if false: loop;   // If not, go to "loop".
    int++;                 // Otherwise, increment #tails.
    jump to: loop;         // Go to "loop".
winner:                    // The "winner" branch.
    check int = 50;        // Is it a draw?
    jump if true: draw;    // If so, go to "draw".
    check int > 50;        // Is tails the winner?
    jump if true: tails;   // If so, go to "tails".
    output = heads;        // Otherwise, heads is the winner.
draw:                      // The "draw" branch.
    output = draw;         // A draw.
tails:                     // The "tails" branch.
    output = tails;        // Tails is the winner.
