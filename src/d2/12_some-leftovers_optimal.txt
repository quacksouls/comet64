> Query: Only output the numbers that have a remainder of 3 when divided by 4.
// Given an input x, we print x if it has a remainder of 3
// after division by 4.  The remainder function is
//
// f(x) := x mod 4
//
// This can be implemented as follows.  Define the quotient by
// q := floor(x / 4), where the floor(x) function is simply
// the integer part of a floating point number x.  Define the
// number n := 4 * q and the remainder can be calculated as
// r := x - n.  This solution is optimal, according to the
// game.
reg = input;         // Read in x.
int = reg / 4;       // The quotient q := floor(x / 4).
int = 4 * int;       // The number n := 4 * q.
int = reg - int;     // The remainder r := x - n.
check int = 3;       // Is the remainder = 3?
jump if false: end;  // If not, go to "end".
output = reg;        // Print x.
end:                 // End of program.
